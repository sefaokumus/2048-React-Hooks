# 2048+ 

This a react version of the game inspired by [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048).

I decied to create React v16.12 (Hooks) version of the this popular game to test my React and problem solving skills. 

You can play it here [2048+](https://react2048.web.app/)

You can set the size of the grid by choosing row and column counts. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can run

### `yarn start`

to play the game locally in develoment mode on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
